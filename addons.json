This addon simply removes that redirection and turns every search result in its original link, saving your time and giving you more security.\n\nWorks on results accessed from http://google.com or https://google.com (and any country variation like google.es, google.co.uk and so on) and from the Firefox search box, works on regular results and Google Blogs, Google News, Google Recipes, Google Images, Google Videos, Google Alerts and even using encrypted.google.com.\n\nIt also cleans up all the links you copy & paste from google search results pages. This is one is a feature most users are looking for and other similar addons don't have.\n\nHow it works (and why it works that way)\n\nWhen I first developed this addon, it worked by changing every single link in every google search result page you load. This is quite expensive (for the browser) and in some cases (like Google Image Search when you scroll down several times and that loads a lot of images) the browser performance get downgraded.\n\nSo the addon does not modifies every google search results links in a page anymore: it waits till you click one of them (left, right or middle button click) or till you open a new tab and paste an url in the url bar: then the addon intercepts the network request (if it is a google redirect) and fixes it and does the request to the final url.\n\nIt's a little complex and not intuitive, but I've found that this is the way to go. Other addons fail when you paste a google result link with a redirect because they only work when you click on it or when you copy it.\n\nI hope it helps you understand the way the addon works.\n\nFeedback\n\nPlease give me feedback as much as you can and suggest features.

More information on canvas fingerprinting can be found at http://www.browserleaks.com/canvas.\n\nThe different block modes are:\n\n    block readout API: All websites not on the white list or black list can use the canvas API to display something on the page, but the readout API is not allowed to return values to the website.\n    fake readout API: Canvas Blocker's default setting, and my favorite! All websites not on the white list or black list can use the canvas API to display something on the page, but the readout API is forced to return a new random value each time it is called.\n    fake at input: on display of text the drawn pixels get modified slightly. This makes the detection of the add-on harder but is less secure. On WebGL-canvas the behaviour is identical to \"fake readout API\".\n    ask for readout API permission: All websites not on the white list or black list can use the canvas API to display something on the page, but the user will be asked if the website should be allowed to use the readout API each time it is called.\n    block everything: Ignore all lists and block the canvas API on all websites.\n    allow only white list: Only websites in the white list are allowed to use the canvas API.\n    ask for permission: If a website is not listed on the white list or black list, the user will be asked if the website should be allowed to use the canvas API each time it is called.\n    block only black list: Block the canvas API only for websites on the black list.\n    allow everything: Ignore all lists and allow the canvas API on all websites.\n\n\nPlease report issues and feature requests at https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker/issues","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/194/194239.png?src=api&modified=1513325485","width":"700","height":"279","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/194/194239.png?src=api&modified=1513325485","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"80"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/191/191763.png?src=api&modified=1513325481","width":"278","height":"283","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/191/191763.png?src=api&modified=1513325481","thumbnailWidth":"147","thumbnailHeight":"150"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/817445/canvasblocker-0.4.4b-an+fx.xpi?src=api","size":102186,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":82,"totalDownloads":258497,"weeklyDownloads":3277,"dailyUsers":24310,"updateDate":1513725610000,"supportURL":null},{"id":"langpack-en-ZA@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/6/6180-32.png?modified=1358351591","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/6/6180-64.png?modified=1358351591"},"name":"English (South African) Language Pack","type":"locale","version":"57.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Dwayne Bailey","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/dwayne-bailey/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Translate.org.za","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/translateorgza/?src=api"},{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"}],"description":"Adds South African English language support to the Firefox browser.

Nobody else decides for you: You choose. You are in full control of your privacy.\n\nOut of the box, uMatrix works in relax block-all/allow-exceptionally mode, meaning web sites which require 3rd-party scripts are likely to be \"broken\". With two clicks, uMatrix can be set to work in allow-all/block-exceptionally mode, which generally will not break web sites. See https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/How-to-use-HTTP-Switchboard:-Two-opposing-views for more details on this topic.\n\n* See ALL the remote connections, failed or attempted, depending on whether they were blocked or allowed (you decide).\n\n* A single-click to whitelist/blacklist one or multiple classes of requests according to the destination and type of data (a blocked request will NEVER leave your browser).\n\n* Efficient blacklisting: cookies won't leave your browser, JavaScript won't execute, plugins won't play, tracking pixels won't download, etc.\n\n* You do not have to solely rely on just one particular curated blacklist (arguably with many missing entries) outside which nothing else can be blocked: You are in full control.\n\n* Ease of use: uMatrix lets you easily whitelist/blacklist net requests which originate from within a web page according to a point-and-click matrix:\n\n- domain names (left column)\n* from very specific\n* to very generic\n\n- type of requests (top row)\n* cookies\n* CSS-related resources (stylesheets and web fonts)\n* images\n* plugins\n* scripts\n* XHR (requests made by scripts)\n* frames\n* others\n\nYou can blacklist/whitelist a single cell, an entire row, a group of rows, an entire column, or the whole matrix with just one click.\n\nuMatrix's filtering engine uses precedence logic to evaluate what is blocked/allowed according to which cells are blacklisted/whitelisted. For example, this allows you to whitelist a whole page with one click, without having to repeatedly whitelist whatever new data appear on the page.\n\nAll rules are scoped. For example, you can block `facebook.com` and `facebook.net` everywhere except when visiting a page on `www.facebook.com`. This way Facebook won't be able to build a profile of your browsing habits.\n\nThe goal of this extension is to make the allowing or blocking of web sites, wholly or partly, as straightforward as possible, so as to encourage users to care about their privacy.\n\nThe extension comes with 3rd-party hosts files totaling over 62,000 distinct hostnames (lists can be selectively disabled/enabled according to your choice).\n\nUltimately, you can choose however you browse the net:\n\n* Blacklist all by default, and whitelist as needed (default mode).\n\n* Whitelist all by default, and blacklist as needed.\n\nEither way, you still benefit from the preset blacklists so that at least you get basic protection from trackers, malware sites, etc. Or you can disable all of these preset blacklists.\n\nYour choice.\n\nRandomly assembled documentation: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki\n\n=====\n\nThis extension is also useful to understand what the web page in your browser is doing, often without your knowledge. You have full ability to see and decide with whom a web page communicates, and to restrict these communications to specific classes of objects within the web page.\n\nThe number which appear in the extension icon correspond to the total number of distinct requests attempted (successfully or not depending on whether these were allowed or blocked) by the web page.\n\nSimply click on the appropriate entry in the matrix in order to white-, black- or graylist a component. Graylisting means the blocked or allowed status will be inherited from another cell with higher precedence in the matrix.\n\nRed square = effectively blacklisted, i.e. requests are prevented from reaching their intended destination:\n* Dark red square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically blacklisted.\n* Faded red square: the blacklist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nGreen square = effectively whitelisted, i.e. requests are allowed to reach their intended destination:\n* Dark green square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically whitelisted.\n* Faded green square: the whitelist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nThe top-left cell in the matrix, the \"all\" cell, represents the default global setting, which allows you to choose whether allowing or blocking everything is the default behavior. Some prefer to allow everything while blocking exceptionally. My personal preference is of course the reverse, blocking everything and allowing exceptionally.\n\nThis extension is also useful if you wish to speed up your browsing, by globally blocking all requests for images as an example.\n\n=====\n\nBUGS, ISSUES: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/issues\n\nSOURCE CODE: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix (GPLv3)\n\nCHANGE LOG: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/releases","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158458.png?src=api&modified=1431417020","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158458.png?src=api&modified=1431417020","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Point and click to allow/block narrow or broad classes of network requests.
