= Firefox profile template

Aims to remove all unnecessary features, maximize privacy and display a traditional UI - like in the good days of firefox.

- Based on https://ffprofile.com
- Reconfigured search engines
- Restored menu and search bar
- Various settings (passwords, ...)
- Added some stuff from https://gist.github.com/haasn/69e19fc2fe0e25f3cff5 (NOT: Cryptography hardening)
  - some of it was already out of date
